## Dependencies and Critical Path

1. **Critical Path**: 
   - Phase 1 (Critical Bug Fixes) → Phase 2 (State Management) → Phase 3 (Performance) → Phase 5 (Deployment)
   - Phase 4 (Testing) can run in parallel with Phase 3

2. **Key Dependencies**:
   - Business form fixes must be completed before state management refactoring
   - API optimizations should be implemented before UI performance improvements
   - Testing should be implemented throughout but formalized in Phase 4
   - Monitoring should be set up before final production deployment

## Risk Management

1. **Technical Risks**:
   - **Schema changes**: Ensure database schema changes are backward compatible
   - **State management refactoring**: Implement incrementally to avoid breaking functionality
   - **Performance optimizations**: Test thoroughly to avoid regression

2. **Mitigation Strategies**:
   - Implement changes in small, testable increments
   - Maintain comprehensive test coverage
   - Set up proper staging environment for validation
   - Have rollback plans for each deployment

## Success Metrics

1. **Functional Metrics**:
   - 100% success rate for business form submissions
   - Zero TypeScript errors in the codebase
   - All features working as expected

2. **Performance Metrics**:
   - 50% reduction in API calls
   - 30% improvement in page load time
   - 90+ Lighthouse performance score
   - <2s Time to Interactive

3. **User Experience Metrics**:
   - Reduced error rates in analytics
   - Improved user retention
   - Positive user feedback

## Rollout Strategy

1. **Staged Rollout**:
   - Deploy to staging environment first
   - Conduct thorough testing
   - Roll out to production in phases
   - Monitor closely after each deployment

2. **Fallback Plan**:
   - Maintain ability to roll back to previous version
   - Have database backup strategy
   - Document all changes for easy troubleshooting

## Post-Implementation Review

After completing all phases, conduct a review to:
- Evaluate success against defined metrics
- Document lessons learned
- Identify areas for future improvement
- Plan for ongoing maintenance and feature development
